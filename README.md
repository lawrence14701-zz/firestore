# firestore

## How I set up the project

1. first i used firebase cdns to set up a connection to my firebase store

2. then i used firebase init and choose hosting and emulators as my features from firebase (hosting is the way we will deploy our site)

3. for emulators i chose hosting emulators, emulators are database functions

4. local is running on port 5000

5. inside our firebase rc we have a config that contains an identifier for our item in the cloud

6. fire base json is a file that is used to customize our services used in firebase

7. to run your local host you can do this command "firebase emulators:start"

8. run firebase deploy to open a deployed site https://fir-learn-d0988.web.app/

9. the admin username is admin@mail.com and the password is password
